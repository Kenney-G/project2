 


 ☐ Enable the rack session cookie middleware.
 ☐ Generate a session secret so that our cookies are securely encrypted.
 ☐ Create a User model that stores an email/username and encrypted password
 ☐ implement the has_secure_password macro in the User model to enable storing an encrypted version of the password and authenticating against that.
 ☐ Build forms for sign up and log in and links to the routes that render them
 ☐ Build out controllers that handle rendering forms and responding to their submission
 ☐ Use the methods from has_secure_password to create user accounts and authenticate them later, storing the user's ID in session cookies using the session hash in our controllers.
